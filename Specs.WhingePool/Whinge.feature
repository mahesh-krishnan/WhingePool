Feature: Whinge
	As a whinger, I would like to whinge to a whinge pool

Background: 
	Given An Azure Storage Configuration of
		| StorageAccount | StorageAccountKey                                                                        |
		| myobpdqaart    | MHDYieseAgGX6HbE8yWK4e0L2eKkUt+an6UbX1/6o0nC2FK2pmgxi/OVW+WEVyH50ROBRMtw0wxf057KDTaDfA== |

	And A Pegasus Configuration of
		| ScheduledTasksQueueName      | RegisteredHandlersTableName | RegisteredHandlersBlobContainerName | RuntimeErrorsTableName                  |
		| whingepool-test-whinge-queue | WhingePoolTestHandlers    | whingepool-test-handler-assemblies  | WhingePoolTestWhingePoolRuntimeErrors |

	And A WhingePool Configuration of
		| WhingesTableName        | WhingersTableName        | WhingePoolsTableName        | WhingesByWhingerTableName        | WhingesByWhingePoolTableName        |
		| WhingePoolTestWhinges | WhingePoolTestWhingers | WhingePoolTestWhingePools | WhingePoolTestWhingesByWhinger | WhingePoolTestWhingesByWhingePool |

	And An ApplicationContext

	And An Empty WhingersTable

	And A Default Set Of Whingers
		| TwitterHandle |
		| johnazariah   |

	And An Empty WhingePoolsTable
	
	And A Default Set Of WhingePools
		| Name  |
		| Test  |
		| Work  |

	And The Current Whinger

Scenario: Save a invalid Whinge of more than 150 characters to an existing WhingePool 
	When A whinge is saved
		| Whinge                                                                                                                                                                                               | WhingePool |
		| I would really like to learn to whinge properly. I really don't know how to keep it short enough for Whinger to accept. Why cannot I learn to whinge within a limit of hundred and fifty characters? | Test       |
	Then An instance of "WhingeTooLongException" exception should be thrown 

Scenario: Save a valid Whinge to an existing WhingePool 
	When A whinge is saved
		| Whinge                          | WhingePool |
		| This is a really common whinge! | Test       |
	Then The save should succeed

Scenario: Save a valid Whinge to an non-existing WhingePool 
	When A whinge is saved
		| Whinge                                     | WhingePool |
		| I hate having to go to the gym in the cold | Exercise   |
	Then A WhingePool should be created
		| Name     |
		| Exercise |
	And The save should succeed
